Code improvement.

Converted the base code into well-segmented code with 3 files. 
- board.py
- player.py
- main.py

We should run the code on main.py file for running the program.

Here is a simple successful test of the program:

Enter name for Player 1: ally
Enter name for Player 2: bob
ally, enter the number of ships (1-5): 1
Place your 1x1 ship (e.g., B3): b3
Choose orientation (H for horizontal, V for vertical): h
bob, enter the number of ships (1-5): 1
Place your 1x1 ship (e.g., B3): c3
Choose orientation (H for horizontal, V for vertical): v

ally's turn to guess:
ally, enter your guess (e.g., B3): b4
It's a miss!

bob's turn to guess:
bob, enter your guess (e.g., B3): b3
It's a hit!
bob wins! All ships of ally are sunk.


-----------NEED FOR IMPROVEMENTS----------------------

- We need to adequately comment each of the functions, and classes file elaborating what each of the function does. 

- There are some rare in-built function calls used like "chr" in "board.py", and "ord" in "player.py". We should explain the use of these calls and also say why did we use them.

----CODING IMPROVEMENTS---

when it ask for, "enter the number of ships (1-5):" and we accidentally enter "c3" or "h or v" it breaks the program and we have to start the function again.


bob, enter the number of ships (1-5): c3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\..\scr\main.py", line 27, in <module>
    main()
  File "c:\Users\..\scr\main.py", line 8, in main
    player2.place_ships()
  File "c:\Users\..\src\player.py", line 10, in place_ships
    num_ships = int(input(f"{self.name}, enter the number of ships (1-5): "))
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'c3'


--Therefore it would be better to modify the code such that it produces warning message such as "Enter a valid value" so that the program doesn't terminate and we don't need to restart the program.

-- Please feel free to work on whichever function you would like to but please make sure what you worked on or will be working in the group chat.

--Please share your inputs in enhancing the program as much as possible.

-- We also need to improve the user interface of the game as well.
