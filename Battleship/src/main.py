This Python program implements a console-based version of the classic Battleship game for two players.

Game Overview:
- Players secretly place a specified number of ships on a 10x10 grid.
- Players take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's ships.
- The game continues until one player successfully sinks all of the opponent's ships.

Key Components:
1. Board Class:
   - Represents the game board for each player, managing ship placement, firing at positions, and checking for sunk ships.
   - Contains methods to print the board, place ships, receive fire from guesses, and check if any ships have been sunk.

2. Player Class:
   - Represents a player in the game, including their name, game board, and tracking of guesses.
   - Includes methods for placing ships on their board and making guesses against the opponent's board, with input validation to enhance user experience.

3. Main Function:
   - Initializes two players and prompts them to enter their names.
   - Facilitates the ship placement phase for both players, ensuring valid input.
   - Implements the main game loop where players alternate turns making guesses until one player's ships are completely sunk.

Error Checking Enhancements:
- The program includes input validation to ensure that users enter positions and orientations correctly, reducing the likelihood of errors during gameplay.
- Clear feedback is provided to users for incorrect inputs, enhancing overall user experience and game flow.

Usage:
- The game is played in the console, where players are prompted to input ship placements and guesses.
- The program keeps track of hits and misses, providing real-time feedback to players.
